        <h3>I am taking this class to get a better understanding of mobile website development.

        I enjoyed the last class on webpage development and like to refine my skills. I am also
        interested in working in this field eventually. I previously took some classes on C++ and
        Python, which is what pointed me in the direction of coding. I wasn't able to finish the
        Python class and would be very interested in learning more with this language. I hope
        to see a Python class being offered at Geekwise some day so I can learn more about it.
        Until then I am happy to work on mobile web development.</h3>
